## About the Repository

This repository includes various C++ programming assignments and projects from my university studies. Each project is designed to build upon the foundations of C programming and delve into advanced concepts specific to C++.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:

1. **Project 1: Working with files**
   - Key Concepts and Topics:
     - **File Compression**: Techniques to reduce the size of data files using Huffman coding.
     - **File Decompression**: Methods to reconstruct original data from compressed files using Huffman coding.
     - **UTF-8 Encoding**: Understanding and manipulating UTF-8 encoded data streams.
     - **Fibonacci Coding**: Techniques for encoding data using Fibonacci coding principles.

2. **Project 2: Data Structures**
   - Key Concepts and Topics:
     - **Arrays**: Basic linear data structure used for storing elements of the same type.
     - **Linked Lists**: Dynamic data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.
     - **Stacks**: Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure useful for applications like expression evaluation.
     - **Queues**: First In, First Out (FIFO) structure commonly used in scheduling and breadth-first search algorithms.
     - **Trees**: Non-linear data structure used for hierarchical representation and efficient searching.

3. **Project 3: Chess Game (Semester Project)**
   - Description: Implementation of a chess game in C++, featuring file-based input/output, a tutorial mode, and three types of AI opponents.
   - Topics: File handling, object-oriented design, AI algorithms (basic strategies).

4. **Project 4: Advanced Concepts**
   - Description: Projects exploring advanced topics in C++ beyond basic object-oriented programming.
   - Topics: Templates, smart pointers, exception handling.

5. **Project 5: GUI Application**
   - Description: Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) application using C++.
   - Topics: GUI libraries (e.g., Qt), event handling, user interface design.

6. **Project 6: Data Structures and Algorithms**
   - Description: Implementation of data structures and algorithms specific to C++.
   - Topics: Advanced data structures (e.g., hash tables, balanced trees), algorithm optimizations.

7. **Project 7: Networking and Multithreading**
   - Description: Projects involving network programming and multithreading in C++.
   - Topics: Socket programming, concurrency, synchronization.

8. **Project 8: Final Project**
