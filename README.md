## About the Repository

This repository includes various C++ programming assignments and projects from my university studies. Each project is designed to build upon the foundations of C programming and delve into advanced concepts specific to C++.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:

1. **Project 1: Polymorphism and Inheritance**
   - Description: Implementation of polymorphic behavior and inheritance hierarchy in C++.
   - Topics: Virtual functions, abstract classes, inheritance relationships.

## Project 2: Data Structures

### Description
In this project, I implemented fundamental data structures in C programming language. These structures are essential for handling and manipulating data efficiently within various applications.

### Key Concepts and Topics
- **Arrays**: Basic linear data structure used for storing elements of the same type.
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Stacks**: Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure useful for applications like expression evaluation.
- **Queues**: First In, First Out (FIFO) structure commonly used in scheduling and breadth-first search algorithms.
- **Trees**: Non-linear data structure used for hierarchical representation and efficient searching.
  
### Projects Included
1. **Array Operations**
   - Description: Basic operations and algorithms on arrays.
   - Topics: Array traversal, searching, sorting.

2. **Linked List Implementation**
   - Description: Implementation of singly linked list and its operations.
   - Topics: Insertion, deletion, traversal.

3. **Stack Applications**
   - Description: Implementing stack operations and applications.
   - Topics: Expression evaluation, function call management.

4. **Queue Implementation**
   - Description: Implementing queue operations and applications.
   - Topics: BFS traversal, job scheduling.

5. **Binary Search Tree**
   - Description: Implementation of a binary search tree.
   - Topics: Insertion, deletion, searching.

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding the efficiency and use cases of different data structures.
- Hands-on experience with implementing data structures in a low-level language like C.
- Insight into memory management and pointer manipulation in C programming.

Each project within this section contributed to my understanding of how data structures operate in real-world applications, laying a strong foundation for more complex algorithmic tasks in subsequent coursework.


3. **Project 3: Chess Game (Semester Project)**
   - Description: Implementation of a chess game in C++, featuring file-based input/output, a tutorial mode, and three types of AI opponents.

   - Topics: Templates, smart pointers, exception handling.

5. **Project 5: GUI Application**
   - Description: Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) application using C++.
   - Topics: GUI libraries (e.g., Qt), event handling, user interface design.

6. **Project 6: Data Structures and Algorithms**
   - Description: Implementation of data structures and algorithms specific to C++.
   - Topics: Advanced data structures (e.g., hash tables, balanced trees), algorithm optimizations.

7. **Project 7: Networking and Multithreading**
   - Description: Projects involving network programming and multithreading in C++.
   - Topics: Socket programming, concurrency, synchronization.
